widget: "Welcome to my website! I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in Economics at
  the University of Texas at Austin. My primary areas of interest are in
  microeconomic theory, information economics and game theory.   My research
  focuses on how asymmetric information affects peopleâ€™s incentive to
  communicate truthfully and how agents can learn and take advantage of
  information revelation processes. For more information, please contact me at:
  kritijain@utexas.edu I expect to graduate in May 2023."
