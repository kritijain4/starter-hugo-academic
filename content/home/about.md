I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My primary areas of interest are in microeconomic theory, information economics and game theory. 

My research focuses on how asymmetric information affects peopleâ€™s incentive to communicate truthfully and how agents can learn and take advantage of information revelation processes.

I expect to graduate in May 2023.
